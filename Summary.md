# Agricultural reform: an overlooked weapon in the counter-climate change arsenal

## Aim: halt climate change and reduce biodiversity loss by unlocking soil's potential for carbon storage.

## Statement of the problem

1. Man-made climate change, acting primarily by way of greenhouse gas emissions, is an acknowledged problem of unprecedented global significance.
1. Attempts to address man-made climate change are already being developed and pursued, notably covering (a) reduction of emissions in the energy and transport sectors per unit of consumption, and (b) reformation of consumer culture in order to reduce units of consumption.
1. Solutions of both these kinds suffer from limitations: the switch to clean energy is a relatively slow process (on the scale of decades), while there is immense political and economic pressure in favor of consumerism.
1. Irreversible effects of man-made climate change are here already; the question is how we can mitigate such effects as effectively and as quickly as possible.
1. While the well-known solutions described above must unquestionably continue to be advanced, the urgency of the situation demands that we pursue every effective course of action available, especially those which are not subject to the same limitations—i.e. solutions which are fast-acting, and which do not require a rejection of consumer culture.

## Proposed solution

Agricultural reform is an overlooked weapon in the fight against climate-change, one which has hardly any media presence as of yet. A large-scale switch to a system of "regenerative organic agriculture" would utilize existing technology and established practices to unlock the enormous potential for soil to absorb carbon dioxide, via processes which are orders of magnitude faster than energy sector reform.

## Theory:

1. Soil absorbs an enormous amount of carbon; globally speaking, it is capable of absorbing four times as much carbon as plants and trees.
1. Current mainstream methods of agriculture degrade massive volumes of soil, causing the soil to release carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere.
1. Restoring degraded soil enables it to reabsorb excessive carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
1. Such restoration currently occurs on farmland practicing "regenerative organic agriculture".
1. "Regenerative organic agriculture" shares many methods with indigenous peoples' and local communities' traditional agricultural methods.
1. Projects which partner with IPLCs both empower them and help to enable the continuation and development of existing traditional practices, while helping non-IPLC partners achieve greater overall sustainability with regard to emissions, water use, pollution and impacts on biodiversity.

## Benefits of agricultural reform over currently prioritized methods of climate change mitigation

1. Rapid effect (scale of months/years).
1. No requirement for a major shift away in consumer lifestyles.
1. Economic advantages (albeit long-term) over current mainstream techniques because of the diminishing yield of degraded soil.
1. Opportunity for job creation (a popular political platform) as regenerative organic agriculture is less amenable to automation.
1. Agricultural reform is needed for independent reasons to ensure global food security in the face of threats from (a) soil degradation, (b) the negative effects of climate change on agriculture, and (c) a rapidly growing global population.

## Roadmap
1. Connect with relevant scientists, politicians, economists, NGOs, farmers, IPLCs.
1. Pool knowledge, policy development, campaign strategies etc.
